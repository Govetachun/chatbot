# chatbot

In this assignment, I am going to use the [Reformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451), also known as the efficient Transformer, to generate a dialogue between two bots.I will feed conversations to model and it will learn how to understand the context of each one. Not only will it learn how to answer questions but it will also know how to ask questions if it needs more info. For example, after a customer asks for a train ticket, the chatbot can ask what time the said customer wants to leave. I can use this concept to automate call centers, hotel receptions, personal trainers, or any type of customer service.
